# Brandon's Backend Development Workspace for COMPS IX

This is a Backend-Development Workspace for the "COMPS IX - Application Development I: Backend" RIZE Class.

This will serve as a workspace which will evenually culminate into me developing a functional Restful API through the knowledge and skills I will learn in the class.

Throughout the next few months I hope to learn more about Git and version control, learning how to properly test and deploy applications for cloud platforms, as well as learning how to structure and manage code while also documenting the process with clarity.

I will use this repository to periodically save and document all of my progress that will lead up to me reaching my goals.
